# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a Rectangle class with attributes for width and height.
class Rectangle
  def initialize(height, width)
  @height = height
  @width = width
  
  end
end
rectangle = Rectangle.new(10, 20)
pp rectangle


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# i was close its all their in my head, the syntax is even in my head now
# i just keep forgetting the order in which it all goes
# also the way the deliberate practice phrases the question i keep forgetting to actually input
# any values into the attributes as it doesn't specifically ask
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I'm going to keep working on classes as I have gotten methods down and they
# are just slightly more complicated versions of the same thing
