# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#  Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.
number = 0
while number < 40
    number = number + 2
    puts number
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? 
# for once Yes i actually was 
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
#  I am going to loop back to working on conditionals as its been the most
#amount of time since I have worked on them
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
