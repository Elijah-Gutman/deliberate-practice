# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.



#Create an array to store 3 words. Then add two more words to the array and print the array on one line.

pp trilogies

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# I had it almost correct a series of times I had it as trilogies.push = ["the god father"]
# Took me having to read the error and look at the answer a few times before I realized i didn't need the equal sign
#and i had to change the type of parenthesis i was using

# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. 
# The skill I need to work on is really just being precise, even after staring at the answer for a couple minutes
# I couldn't figure out what was wrong until i copied and pasted it into the same terminal
# What i learned is why all the devs i know use multiple screens instead of tabbing in and out of windows 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I am actually pretty good at remembering the details from memory I just suffer from the same issue i had in college
# I would do the math equation perfectly then subract instead of add a negative number
# I would write a perfect paper with spelling errors the average third grade could catch, aka a lack of prescision
