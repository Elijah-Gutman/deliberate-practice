# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

greeting = 1

while greeting <= 5
    puts "hello"
    greeting = greeting + 1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. 

# I was able to do this one from Memory actuaklly, the skill I want to work on  next is creating my own classes 
# Because I know I dont reacall how to do that from memory and thusly I need the practice :)
