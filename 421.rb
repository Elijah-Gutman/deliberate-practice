# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# 
# Write a method that takes in three strings and returns a string that combines all 
# three strings with spaces in 
# between. Then run the method and print the result.
 def interpolate(word1, word2, word3)
  return word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3
   
 end
pp interpolate("I", "am" , "here")

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# No, i had to look at some previous examples but I learned a lot from this
# particular practice in both syntax and how interpolation works
# when using methods
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# 
#Im going to keep working on methods, I am improving  my memory of syntax
