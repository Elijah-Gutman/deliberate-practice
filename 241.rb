# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a method that takes in a string and returns the string with all capital 
# letters. Then run the method and print the result.
def example(word)
    word.upcase
end
puts example("hello")

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# I was 30% of the way there, I did not recall where I was supposed to place certain
# parts of the code
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# I need to keep working on custom classes and methods as they are not stickinb in  my head
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
