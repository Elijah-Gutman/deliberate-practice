# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times two. 
# Then run the method and print the result.

def double(number)
    return number * 2
end
  
puts double(5)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# Not at all I had completly forgotten what a method was and how to write one
# I knew I had forgotten though and thats why I chose this particular exersise  to work
# on my weaknesses and further humble myself as if this whole process wasn't enough 

# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I intend to do more  basic work with methods as a means of working further on this
