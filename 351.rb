# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# 

# Write a Location class with attributes for latitude and longitude.

class Location

  def initialize(longitude, latitude)
  @longitude = longitude
  @latitude = latitude
  end
end

location = Location.new(41.23,34.45)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# No but I at least had the idea inside of my head this time,
# I had to rely extensivly on the material to make this work 
# they are simple but i've done very few of these so I am working on remembering 
# the syntax
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# The syntax, so i will keep working on unique methods until i get the syntax down
