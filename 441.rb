# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a Song class with attributes for name, artist, and duration.
# 

 class Song
   def initialize(name, artist, duration)
 
   
  @artist = artist
  @name = name
  @duration = duration

 end
end

song = Song.new("Califorication", "Red Hot Chilli Peppers", "5:22")

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# I was pretty darn close, just basic syntax error
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I need to keep working on classes as I am close to having them entirely in my memory bank
# The issue was remembering where "def" came in as i had forgotten it was inside the class
# block of code and not in its own sepetated from it
