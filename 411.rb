# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#
# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times itself. 
# Then run the method and print the result.
def square(number)
  return number * number
end

pp square(4)
  

#   def initialize(number)
#   number = Multiply * Multiply
#   end
# end

# number = Multiply.new(2)



# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# No, I tried to do this mxing up classes and methods
# But i am making improvments in actually remembering the syntax
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# I will continue to work on classes and methods as its my weak point
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
