# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#  Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever 
# until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.


 while true
    puts "Type out a word"
    input = gets.chomp
    if input.length > 5
        break
    end
 end

 # Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
 # I was able to get about 80% of it by memory I had forgotten to start the while loop
 # with a true statement as a means to keep it "running until...."
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I am focussing on my loops right now because peter alluded the to fact they were more 
# critical to know rather than simply remembering houw to do hashes and methods from memory
