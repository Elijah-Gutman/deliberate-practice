# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a method that takes in two numbers and returns the first number subtracted 
# by the second. Then run the method and print the result.


def example(number1, number2)
    return number1 - number2
end

pp example(3,2)


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# Not even close
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# as suspected my memory of methods has gaps so I will continue to work on them
# I actually intend to do this exact same one as my methodology when trying to do it
# from memory was highy suspect and definitly needs work
