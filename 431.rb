# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# 
 # Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times 10 plus 30.
 # Then run the method and print the result.
 def math(number)
   number * 10 + 30
 end
pp math(10)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# for the first time yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# going to advance futher with more complicated methods as its STILL my weakest point
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
